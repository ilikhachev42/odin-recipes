  	<h2>Description</h2>
  	<p><strong>Kurnik</strong> also known as <i>wedding pirog</i> or <i>tsar pirog</i>, is a dome-shaped savoury Russian pirog usually filled with chicken or turkey, eggs, onions, kasha or rice, and other optional components. Sometimes filled with boiled rooster combs, this pirog originated in Southern Russia, especially in Cossack communities, and was used as a "wedding pirog" in the rest of the country. It is dome-shaped, unlike any other non-sweet pirog. In special cases, it was served to tsar himself. Even today, this pirog is served on special occasions in most of Russia.</p>
